MICROSERVICE ARCHITECTURE 
-Breaking down of one single monolithic architecture into multiple small functionalities 

DNS - To map IP using browser(Every name has a ip associated so when we call sclaer.com it actually calls the ip)
The request DNS servers goes to Load Balancer. Now request goes to Authorisation/Authentication service. Now it goes to accounts service . Then a Load Balancer Service 



TWO TYPES OF LOAD BALANCING:
-Path Based Routing
-Instance Based Routing


One MICROSERVICE should talk to one Database and it is known as Single Database Service Principle 

-------------READ THREE AXIS OF SCALABILITY-----------------------


POLYGLOT- A person who can speak multiple language. In programming terms different programming language 

All LB should have capabilities to service discovery : When a new instance of a service comes up or existing service goes down 



Two types of communication bw MICROSERVICES:
- Synchronous: You talk and you wait for response (eg: talking to gf on call)
- Asynchronous: You talk to multiple stuff (eg: talking on whatsapp)
    -PubSub model 
    -Queue model

-------------Read Twelve Factor App-------------------

-------------Read Microservice should be stateless---------------


Two Type of Dependencies: 
-Service Dependency 
-Component Dependency
